Im currently a Software Engineer at Google. I co-founded the [FHE Transpiler](https://github.com/google/fully-homomorphic-encryption) project and FHE team at Google. I currently work on [HEIR](https://github.com/google/heir/), [Jaxite](https://github.com/google/jaxite) and related technologies  to bring FHE to practical use on hardware accelerators such as TPUs, FPGAs, ASICs and Photonics. Im interested in making next generation crytography easy to use with compilers and hardware. I love working at the intersection of Machine Learning and Cryptography and some medical things along the way.

I enjoy attending and being part of FHE conferences i.e. [fhe.org](https://fhe.org/), [Workshop of Applied Homomorphic Encryption](https://homomorphicencryption.org/workshops/) and [Homomorphic Encryption Standardization Workshop](https://homomorphicencryption.org/standards-meetings/). Im on the [advisory board](https://fhe.org/advisory-board/) for fhe.org.


Before this, I worked on enabling personal references for Google Assistant (Example: Navigate to my mom's house).  

And before that, I worked on predicting features of a place on Google Maps (Example: whether a restaurant is wheel chair accesible).

I finished my Masters at University of Pennsylvania with a heavy focus on Encrypted Search under the guidance of Nadia Heninger and Brett Hemmenway.
